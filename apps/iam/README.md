# IAM

Control Plane identity, authentication, authorization, and tenant-security
boundary. Resource access must be tenant-scoped and auditable.

## Ownership metadata

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owner | `TBD-018` |
| SLO | [Placeholder](../../ops/slo/README.md) |
| Runbook | [Placeholder](../../ops/runbooks/README.md) |
| Upgrade window | `TBD; assign with the runtime owner` |
| Data retention responsibility | `TBD if persistent data is introduced; none in TASK-M0-001` |

Cross-domain integration must use stable APIs or versioned events. Source is
traceable by Git revision; release version topology remains TBD under
`REQ-REP-006`.
